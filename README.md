# P008_Bluetooth_interface
This is the code for a 32 bits STM32F051 microcontroller from ST. This code is to control a WINSTAR OLED screen, a RN4020 bluetooth 4.1 BLE module from microchip, the battery charger, some buttons with a led and a serial port for the EXAR USB-UART (XR21B1411).
Also it set ups the RTC and uses a supercap to have a clock even when the power supply is off.
